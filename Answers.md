# Technical questions

1. I spent around 2 hours and a half to implement all features. With more time, some good upgrades could be implemented:

   1. use a react router (_USE_REACT_ROUTER_ Cmd+F on it).

   2. beautify loading state "..." by a breathing animation for example.

   3. Try to create a more generic _Select_ component for select Season component.

   4. Upgrade alert message of failing requests.

   5. Add a modal/view with details of a game by clicking on it.

   6. Adrien asked me to not implement the responsive, with more time I'll have implemented it.

   7. Add a translation library like i18next.

   8. Use a custom font.

   9. Customize scroll bars.

2. The implementation of the design took me around 1 hour and a half. I spent more time on the stats part to avoid redundancy in the CSS.

3. I think i have already optimized the loading by fetching asynchronously requests and I used compressed images. If we want to optimize more loading, we can use graphQL to use more light requests.

# Bonus questions
