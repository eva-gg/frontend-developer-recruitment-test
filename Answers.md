## Technical Answers

1. How long did you spend on the feature implementation? What would you add/change to your solution if you had more time?

It takes me about 8 hours to finish the project to its actual state.
- About 30min / 1h of init project (init, routing, lib install, etc..)
- About 2 hours for services/hooks creation and types
- 1 hour to implement fetching logic
- 4 hour for integration (responsive included)
- 1 hour for the skeletons (was looking for some suitable packages)

If I had more time I probably would have improved the types logic with typescript because some types aren't recognized in vue template.
Also, I would have separate the Profile.vue file into some smart components that are handling their own data call + made a system to show empty data on saison change.
I probably would have take the time for looking for each small things that i haven't seen while integration.
And would probably create a vite config instead of using vue-cli

2. How long did you spend on the design integration? What was the main difficulties you encounter?

As mentioned above, the integration take me 4 hours, including the responsive. This is probably the main part of the time spent.
The main difficulties i encounter are due to adobe.xd which prevented me from getting the exact size of certain elements.

And also standardize the size of elements, because of using tailwindcss, I try to harmonize spacing and size so as not to have a variable file that's too verbose

3. How would you optimize the loading time for this page? Have you ever had to work on that?

Probably by optimizing images weight (handmade or with a tool like [kraken.io](https://kraken.io/)), reducing the request number and reducing payloads (like doing a pagination for the game history table).
Yes I've already worked on that kind of features
